# IDI0T-Proofing-Functions

Hello Everyone!

This is a public repo designed to help and assist anyone that it may come by. Feel free to copy this code or be inspired by it ^v^

These functions are meant to get input from the user, validate it, and return it; nothing more. This will include 36 user-input validation functions that you can use for years to come when writing other programs.
