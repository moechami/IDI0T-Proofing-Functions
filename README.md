# IDI0T-Proofing-Functions

Hello Everyone!

This is a public repo designed to help and assist anyone that it may come by. Feel free to copy this code or be inspired by it :)

These functions are meant to get input from the user, validate it, and return it; nothing more. Therefore, none of these functions may display any message or values other than the original message and a request to try again. Remember, cin knows what data type it’s trying to read and will return an error if the data type is wrong, so there’s no need to read data as a string and parse it yourself.

This will include 36 user-input validation functions that you can use for years to come when writing other programs.
